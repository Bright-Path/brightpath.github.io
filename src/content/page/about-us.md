  ### Our Story


  Bright Path Brewing was founded with a simple mission, create refreshing ​​lagers and low-ABV session beers for everyone to enjoy. All in a setting that exudes cozy small-town vibes.


  Alex Franko and Dillon Smith began dreaming up their vision for Bright Path Brewery after years in the industry. Their time at multiple breweries has driven home the community mindset and that breweries are a huge part of the communities that they operate in. Alex and Dillon have a vision for creating fresh, easy-drinking beer, hosting local food trucks and events for the community to connect with. After years of planning, the first locally owned and operated small craft brewery in Jim Thorpe, PA is ready to pour you a liter. 


  ### Our Roots


  Alex Franko and Dillon Smith grew up in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania and both have strong local pride. This drew them back to Jim Thorpe after years in the brewing industry to start Bright Path Brewing.
