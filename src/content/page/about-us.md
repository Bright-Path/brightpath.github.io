  Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress
  like you're doing your laundry? When will that be? Oh dear! She's stuck in an
  infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.


  Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Ooh, name it after me! Ooh, name it after me! __Wow!__ *A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin?* You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.


  ## Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.


  Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.


  1. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

  2. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

  3. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.


  ### You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?


  What are their names? Anyone who laughs is a communist! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Actually, that's still true.


  * You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

  * That's not soon enough!

  * I'll get my kit!


  We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.


  Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.


  Ask her how her day was. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? It must be wonderful. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!


  Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
