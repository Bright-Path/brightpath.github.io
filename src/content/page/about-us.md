  Bright Path Brewing was founded with a simple mission: to create refreshing
  flavorful ​​lagers and low-ABV session beers for everyone to enjoy. All in a
  setting that exudes cozy small-town vibes.


  Bright Path is our community, the place Alex Franko and Dillon Smith grew up and have a connection to. Though Alex and Dillon left home to build their careers and hone their craft, ultimately, their paths led them back here to their hometown of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. A place they want to put down roots, raise their families, and grow their business to be a part of this community’s bright future.


  Alex and Dillon believe breweries are a huge part of the communities they operate in and have a vision for creating fresh, easy-drinking beer while hosting local food trucks and events for the community to connect with. After years of planning, our doors are open, and we invite you to stop by to let us pour you a liter.
