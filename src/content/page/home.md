  Bright Path Brewing is the first locally owned and operated small craft
  brewery in rural Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. We focus on ​​lager and low-ABV
  session beers.


  The name Bright Path was inspired by the translation of Jim Thorpe’s Native American name, Wa-Tho-Huk. The brewery is home to our taproom where we serve our latest releases and crowd favorites with the occasional food truck days. Packaged to-go beer, kegs, and merchandise are available in the taproom as well.
