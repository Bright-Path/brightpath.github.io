  Bright Path Brewing is a locally owned and operated small craft brewery in
  rural Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. We focus on flavorful ​​lagers and low-ABV
  session beers.


  The brewery is home to our taproom where we serve our latest releases and crowd favorites with the occasional food truck days. Packaged to-go beer, kegs, and merchandise are available in the taproom as well.
