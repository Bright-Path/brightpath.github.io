  Bright Path is a multi-family, multi-generational, locally owned and operated
  small craft brewery in rural Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. We focus on flavorful
  ​​lagers and low-ABV session beers. 


  The brewery is home to our taproom where we serve our latest releases and crowd favorites with the occasional food truck day. It is a place for everyone to gather, support one another, and feel welcome. Customers are welcome to bring well behaved dogs on a leash.


  We also offer packaged to-go beer, kegs, and merch in the taproom as well.
