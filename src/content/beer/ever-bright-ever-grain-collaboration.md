  Crisp | Hoppy | Fruity


  We brewed this beer in collaboration with our friends at Ever Grain Brewing. We used malts from Deer Creek Malthouse and our favorite hop Nelson Sauvin. We also threw in a Phantasma powder for fun.  The result is a crisp lager with notes of white grapes and fresh fruits. Itâ€™s a perfect summer Lager.
