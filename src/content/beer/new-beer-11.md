description: >-
  Chocolatey | Smooth | Floral


  This classic English brown ale is brewed with Marris Otter, Chocolate malt and

  roasted malts and over 50 lbs of fresh Chinook hops. The hops are picked by our

  friends at Murphyâ€™s Hop Yard and then we use them within 24hrs of being picked.

  The result is a robust brown ale with awesome piney and citrus notes from the

  fresh hops.
