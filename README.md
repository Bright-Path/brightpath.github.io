## Website Structure
Please reference this guide to gain insight on the inner workings of the project, file structure and methodology.

### Branching Strategy

### Basic Structure
```
src/
    > admin:    Netlify and CSM config
    > assets:   Default site assets
    > uploads:  CMS generated assets
    > content:  content generated by the Netlify CMS
    > pages:    All site pages and page templates
    > partials: Page pieces, components, layouts, global styles
```

### Additional Details On Structure

`content`: There are several subdirectories that are generated by the CMS.

`pages`: Contains all reusable pages, e.g. blog post, or singletons - all in which reserve an entire webpage space.

`partials`: `/components`: atomic pieces used across the app. `/layouts`: Structure in which a page is designed to fit. `/styles`: reset, typography, and variables used across the project.


### Pages, Layouts, Components Methodology

Three categories that make up the site are pages, layouts and components. Pages are the macro structure compiled from a number of layouts and components that build a single user experience. Pages are listed in the `src/` directory above.

Layouts are sections or pieces of the page. Layouts define a structure; for example the `src/partials/layouts/base.njk` file contains the necessary `<html>` and `<header>` tags necessary to build a page. The inner structure of that file contains a block named `template` that can be swapped with other layouts or components to fulfill the needs of the page. All layouts are contained within the `src/partials/layouts` directory.

Components are modular pieces in the `src/partials/components` directory that complete an atomic task or are necessary in multiple layouts and or pages across the application.
